The main change that I had in mind was in the


## Interesting Moments
1. I actually struggled with getting Context to only implement parts of a concept at first. I was using "implement:" instead of "prompt:". using the latter allowed me to incrementally implement my concepts using Context. In [this snapshot](context/design/concepts/UserAuthentication/implementation.md/steps/response.9eb27d0e.md) was what I got from using "implement:" no matter what. I tried adding instructions after the "implement:" line but they seemed to have no effect. [This one](context/design/concepts/UserAuthentication/implementation.md/steps/response.e9277c70.md) was what I got when I used prompt. I continued this strategy to incrementally develop all of my concepts

2. When first approaching tests, I came across a strange error. The only tests I had were for my User Authenticationʻs register action, but for some reason it would error like so:

I couldnʻt figure out what was wrong, so what I did was went back to the UserAuthentication testing.md file and asked it for help. I put in [this prompt](context/design/concepts/UserAuthentication/testing.md/steps/prompt.175523c2.md) and [the current, failing test file](context/design/concepts/UserAuthentication/testing.md/steps/file.d6057bde.md). I also outlines what the error was. The result was new test code which I ran and it ended up working without running into the same error as before!

3. I came to the realization when I was working on my second concept (MusicTagging) that when I am prompting Context for tests, I shouldnʻt only pass in a code implementation of the concept since it doesnʻt really "know" the operational principle of the concept on its own. To follow this idea, I started passing in the concept specification file. This ended up bringing about a bunch of other problems. [In this snapshot](context/design/concepts/MusicTagging/testing.md/20251011_151131.ee58ae05.md), you can see how Context tried making its own register function. I had to change and test out the prompt over multiple iterations to end up with something that had the test suite actually written correctly. I believe that now Context knows that it should use the operational principle when designing tests.

4. Towards the end of my work on the MusicTagging concept, I realized that the assignment instructions say to only have 4-6 tests that test a detailed scenario. As you can see in these snapshots of my [UserAuthentication tests](context/src/concepts/UserAuthentication/UserAuthenticationConcept.test.ts/20251011_141435.4f3cce5e.md) and [MusicTagging tests](context/src/concepts/MusicTagging/MusicTaggingConcept.test.ts/20251011_210555.ed240fa2.md), they did not follow these instructions well. In order to remedy this, I used Context to generate a more proper test suite by also passing in the assignment instructions as a part of the prompt (see this [snapshot](context/design/concepts/UserAuthentication/testing.md/steps/prompt.7fc64005.md) of my new UserAuthentication prompt as an example). Going forward from this point, I adopted a new way of querying Context for tests. As I iteratively implement actions, I will essentially tell the llm to add more to the "story" the the tests are testing using the newly implemented action. This allows for a concise and thorough test suite that can be built layer by layer (where the layers are actions as I implement them).

5. I tried basically everything I could think of to get Context to augment the tests to use the AI part of the MusicTagging correctly. No matter what I did, it seemed like Context just refused to simply initialize the Gemini LLM util to call the API. So many issues came up with its tests. For example, it tried making a "mock LLM" in nearly every single response, like [in this one](context/design/concepts/MusicTagging/testing.md/steps/response.caf51824.md). It got to the point that I was worried that I was burning through my Gemini credits too fast, especially since the amount of tokens I put in and got out was immense. As a result, I ended up having to augment the tests that test the suggestTags method manually. I added tests for two situations: one where the model should suggest and add tags successfully, and one where the description is such that it shouldn't be able to give any tags (and error)

## Other Notes

Basically my approach for implementing went like ask Context to implement one action, make tests for that one action, check that everything works, if so then ask Context to add onto the current implementation (without changing anything) and test it and so forth. If an error comes up, Iʻll point to the current implementation/testing file and tell Context what was wrong with it.

In /design/concepts are folders containing all relevant files relating to the design of each concept. implementation.md is the file in which I prompted Context for a partial implementation of the concept. specification.md contains the concept spec for that folder. testing.md is the file in which I prompted Context for tests to the concept implementation.

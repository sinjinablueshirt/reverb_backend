**Purpose:** to let file information be uploaded and displayed

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/FileUrl/requestUpload

**Description:** Initiates a file upload process by providing a pre-signed URL for direct Google Cloud Storage interaction.

**Requirements:**
- `fileName` isn't empty.
- No other file with `fileName` has been uploaded by `owner` (i.e., no confirmed file with this name for this user).

**Effects:**
- Generates a unique `gcsObjectName` that embeds a temporary file ID.
- Creates a pre-signed `uploadUrl` that allows the client to upload directly to GCS for a limited time.
- Returns both the `uploadUrl` and the `gcsObjectName`.
- (No database record is created at this stage).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "fileName": "string",
  "owner": "string"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**
```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "string",
  "gcsObjectName": "string"
}
```

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

### POST /api/FileUrl/confirmUpload

**Description:** Finalizes a file upload, verifying its presence in Google Cloud Storage and recording its metadata in the system.

**Requirements:**
- An object exists in GCS with `gcsObjectName`.
- The `owner` and `fileName` provided as arguments match the information encoded within `gcsObjectName`.
- No `File` record already exists in the database with the file ID embedded in `gcsObjectName`.

**Effects:**
- Verifies the existence of the uploaded object in GCS.
- Extracts the unique file ID (`_id`) from `gcsObjectName`.
- Constructs a permanent public URL for retrieving the file.
- Saves a new `File` record in the concept's state (MongoDB) with `fileName`, `gcsObjectName`, `owner`, and `url`.
- Returns the ID of the newly created `File` record.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "fileName": "string",
  "gcsObjectName": "string",
  "owner": "string"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**
```json
{
  "file": "string"
}
```

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

### POST /api/FileUrl/deleteFile

**Description:** Removes a file's metadata from the system and deletes its corresponding content from Google Cloud Storage.

**Requirements:**
- `file` exists.
- `user` is its `owner`.

**Effects:**
- Removes `file` from the concept's state (MongoDB).
- Deletes the corresponding file content from the external Google Cloud Storage service, rendering its `url` inaccessible.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "file": "string",
  "user": "string"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**
```json
{}
```

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

### POST /api/FileUrl/_getFilesByUser

**Description:** Retrieves metadata for all files owned by a specific user.

**Requirements:**
- `user` exists (conceptually, or an active user session).

**Effects:**
- Returns an array of `File` documents (metadata) owned by the specified `user`.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "user": "string"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Query):**
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "string",
    "owner": "string",
    "url": "string",
    "gcsObjectName": "string",
    "fileName": "string"
  }
]
```

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

---

### POST /api/FileUrl/_getFileById

**Description:** Fetches metadata for a single file identified by its unique ID.

**Requirements:**
- none

**Effects:**
- Returns the `File` document (metadata) matching the given `fileId`, or `null` if not found.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "fileId": "string"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Query):**
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "string",
    "owner": "string",
    "url": "string",
    "gcsObjectName": "string",
    "fileName": "string"
  }
]
```
*(If the file is not found, an empty array `[]` will be returned instead of an array containing a null object.)*

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

### Changes to TagSearch (now MusicTagging)
A big change that I made from my initial design was to the TagSearch concept. I explained some of this in the last assignment since TagSearch is also my AI-augmented concept.

Firstly, I changed its name from TagSearch to MusicTagging to align with what I want it to accomplish for my app.

The main change (aside from the AI augmentation) is that I made the state a set of "registries" with a resource and tag set under each one. In practice, resource would be something like an id for a comment or post. The actions were also adjusted to work with this new structure, but otherwise remain the same in behavior.

For the AI augmentation I was mainly thinking of having the AI suggest comment tags based on the content of the comment when a user is giving feedback. These changes are in the principle, state, and actions. For the state I added a "description" field to each registry so that this would be how an LLM gets the context it needs to suggest tags. An LLM-powered action "suggestTags" was added which is the main thing that interacts with the LLM.

When I was making these changes, I wanted to try out having Context generate the concept spec for me. I provided it basically everything but the actions for the concept as seen in [this snapshot](../../../context/design/concepts/MusicTagging/generate-spec.md/20251011_144312.5366f730.md). As a result, it gave me a full concept, which I checked. I used most of its actions without change in my actual specification for MusicTagging

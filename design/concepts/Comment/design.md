# Changes to Comment
My Comment concept did not change as much. The only real difference is that I don't include an "owner" of the resources which comments are tied to. I removed this because it seems more fitting to be a part of a different concept, and the owner of the resource wasn't really used at any point in the actions of the Comment concept.

The other change from my original design was that at the time I just used some dateTime type to work with timestamping comments. I did this because at the time I didn't really know what date/time type to use. Now, it uses the Date type.

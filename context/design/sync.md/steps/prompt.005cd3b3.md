# prompt: refine these synchronizations you gave above to handle authentication. Do not add new concepts that don't exist. refer to the sync background for ensuring that actions are authenticated. an example of an authenticated action is the remove comment action. Only the user who made the comment can remove it. Make sure this authenticating logic using the "when" statement is present for all routes that would require authorization (removeComment, deleteUser, addTag, etc.). Remember that there is no such this as a Sessioning concept so don't make one up

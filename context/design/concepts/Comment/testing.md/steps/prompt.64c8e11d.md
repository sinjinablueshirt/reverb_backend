# prompt: add console.logs that display helpful messages to the console with action inputs and outputs so that a human reader can make sense of the test execution when it runs in the console. add green checkmark when tests pass. use a red X only when a test fails. DO NOT CHANGE ANY TESTS. SIMPLY ADD CONSOLE LOGS.

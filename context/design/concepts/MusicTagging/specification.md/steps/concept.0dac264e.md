# concept: MusicTagging\[File, GeminiLLM]

* **purpose**: to classify sets of music files with descriptors so they can be easily retrieved later.

* **principle**: after a set of music files are registered with a description, the user can manage tags associated with that file. They may ask an AI to suggest tags based on the description of the file. Tags can be attached or removed later. They can search for files that have a specific tag attached and delete files.

* **state**
  * a set of Registry with
    * a `files` set of `File`
    * a `description` of type `String`
    * a `tags` set of `String`

* **actions**
  * `register(files: set of File, description: String): (registry: Registry)`
    * **requires** The given `files` are not already part of any existing `Registry` entry. The `description` is not empty.
    * **effects** Creates a new `Registry` entry. Associates the `files` with the `description`. Initializes the `tags` set for this new `Registry` to be empty. Returns the newly created `Registry`.

  * `addTag(registry: Registry, tag: String)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state. `tag` (case-insensitive) is not already in the `registry`'s `tags` set.
    * **effects** Adds the `tag` to the `tags` set of the specified `registry`.

  * `removeTag(registry: Registry, tag: String)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state. `tag` (case-insensitive) is present in the `registry`'s `tags` set.
    * **effects** Removes the `tag` from the `tags` set of the specified `registry`.

  * `async suggestTags(registry: Registry, llm: GeminiLLM)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state.
    * **effects** Uses the provided `llm` (large language model) to generate a set of relevant tags based on the `registry`'s `description`. For each suggested tag, if it is not already in the `registry`'s `tags` set, it is added.

  * `unregister(registry: Registry)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state.
    * **effects** Removes the specified `registry` entry, including its associated `files`, `description`, and `tags`, from the concept's state.

**Rationale for added actions:**

1. **`register`**: The principle states, "after a set of music files are registered with a description..." This clearly indicates the need for an action to create these `Registry` entries. It defines the initial state of a registered set of files (empty tags).
2. **`addTag` / `removeTag`**: The principle mentions, "the user can manage tags associated with that file. Tags can be attached or removed later." While `suggestTags` adds tags, explicit actions for direct user control over adding and removing tags are crucial for "managing" them.
3. **`unregister`**: The principle states, "and delete files." This action allows for the removal of a `Registry` entry, which implies deleting the association of files and their tags from the system. This provides completeness for the lifecycle of a `Registry` entry.

**Note on Queries:** The principle mentions, "They can search for files that have a specific tag attached." As per the "Concept queries" section, such queries are often implicitly supported by the state being visible. An explicit query `getFilesWithTag(tag: String): (files: set of File)` could be added if its behavior were complex or non-trivial, but for simple state lookups, it might not be strictly necessary to define explicitly in the specification.

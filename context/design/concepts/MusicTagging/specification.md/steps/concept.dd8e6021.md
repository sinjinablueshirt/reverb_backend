# concept: MusicTagging\[Resource, GeminiLLM]

* **purpose**: to classify sets of resources with musical descriptors so they can be easily retrieved later.

* **principle**: after a set of resources are registered with a description, the user can manage tags associated with those resources. They may ask an AI to suggest tags based on the description of the resources. Tags can be attached or removed later. They can search for resources that have a specific tag attached and delete them.

* **state**
  * a set of Registry with
    * a `resources` set of `Resource`
    * a `description` of type `String`
    * a `tags` set of `String`

* **actions**
  * `registerResources (resources: set of Resource, description: String): (registry: Registry)`
    * **requires** No existing `Registry` entry in the state has this exact set of `resources`.
    * **effects** A new `Registry` entry is created in the concept's state with the given `resources`, `description`, and an empty set of `tags`. The identifier of the new `Registry` entry is returned.

  * `addTag (registry: Registry, tag: String)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state and `tag` is not already present in `registry.tags`.
    * **effects** `tag` is added to the `tags` set of the specified `registry`.

  * `removeTag (registry: Registry, tag: String)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state and `tag` is present in `registry.tags`.
    * **effects** `tag` is removed from the `tags` set of the specified `registry`.

  * `deleteRegistry (registry: Registry)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state.
    * **effects** The specified `registry` entry and all its associated data are removed from the state.

  * `async suggestTags(registry: Registry, llm: GeminiLLM)`
    * **requires** `registry` exists in the state.
    * **effects**
      * The `llm` is invoked with a prompt derived from `registry.description` (e.g., "Suggest musical descriptors or tags for the following: \[registry.description]").
      * The `llm` generates a set of potential tags based on the description.
      * For each tag suggested by the `llm`, if that tag is *not already present* in `registry.tags`, it is added to `registry.tags`.
      * Existing tags in `registry.tags` are not removed or altered by this action.
      * If the `llm` suggests no new tags, `registry.tags` remains unchanged.

**Reasoning for the `suggestTags` refinement:**

The original `effects` for `suggestTags` stated: "uses llm to create and assign a set of tags that fit the description... Cannot assign a tag if it is already in registry's tags set."

1. **"assign a set of tags"**: This could imply replacement of existing tags. The refined version clarifies that it *adds* new, unique tags, aligning with the `addTag` action and the principle of user management.
2. **"Cannot assign a tag if it is already in registry's tags set"**: This constraint is directly incorporated into the refined `effects` statement, making it explicit how uniqueness is maintained.
3. **Clarity on LLM interaction**: It explicitly mentions invoking the LLM with a prompt derived from the description and processing its output.
4. **No removal**: It explicitly states that existing tags are not removed, which is crucial for predictable behavior.

This revised `suggestTags` action provides a more robust and unambiguous specification for implementation.

# response:

Here is a concept design for `FileManagement[File, User]` based on the provided guidelines:

***

**concept** FileManagement \[File, User]

**purpose** allow users to upload, store, and manage files, each with a defined owner

**principle** If a user uploads a new file with a specific name and content, they become its owner. Subsequently, the user can rename or delete this file, but only if they are the owner, ensuring control over their digital assets.

**state**
  a set of Files with
    an owner User
    a name String
    a contentReference String  // A unique identifier, URI, or path to the actual file content in an external storage
    an uploadTime DateTime
    a size Number // Size in bytes

**actions**
  uploadFile (by: User, name: String, contentRef: String, fileSize: Number): (file: File)
    **requires**
      there is no File f such that f.owner is 'by' and f.name is 'name' (ensuring unique file names per user)
    **effects**
      create a new File f\_new
      set f\_new.owner to 'by'
      set f\_new.name to 'name'
      set f\_new.contentReference to 'contentRef'
      set f\_new.uploadTime to the current time
      set f\_new.size to 'fileSize'
      return f\_new

  renameFile (file: File, by: User, newName: String)
    **requires**
      file exists in the set of Files
      file.owner is 'by' (only the owner can rename a file)
      there is no other File f' such that f'.owner is 'by' and f'.name is 'newName' (ensuring the new name is also unique for the user)
    **effects**
      set file.name to 'newName'

  deleteFile (file: File, by: User)
    **requires**
      file exists in the set of Files
      file.owner is 'by' (only the owner can delete a file)
    **effects**
      remove file from the set of Files

  downloadFile (file: File, by: User): (contentReference: String)
    **requires**
      file exists in the set of Files
      file.owner is 'by' (only the owner can get the content reference for download)
    **effects**
      return file.contentReference

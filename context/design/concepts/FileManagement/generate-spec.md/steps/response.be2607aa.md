# response:

Here is the concept design for `FileManagement` following the provided guidelines:

```
**concept** FileManagement [File, User]

**purpose** Enable users to securely store, retrieve, and organize digital files, while maintaining ownership and access control.

**principle** If a user requests to upload a file, the system provides a temporary, unique presigned URL for direct client-to-cloud-storage upload. After the client successfully uploads the file using this URL, the system registers the file under the user's ownership and makes it accessible for retrieval by its owner, but prevents unauthorized deletion.

**state**
  a set of Files with
    owner: User             // The user who owns this file
    originalName: String    // The file name provided by the user during upload request
    storageKey: String      // The unique identifier/path for the file in cloud storage (e.g., GCS object name)
    contentUrl: String      // The stable, publicly accessible (or presigned for private files) URL to the file content
    status: UploadStatus    // Current status of the file upload (PENDING, UPLOADED, FAILED)
  nextFileId: Number = 1    // Internal counter for generating unique File identifiers

// Enum for UploadStatus (implicitly defined by usage in state and actions)
// UploadStatus = {PENDING, UPLOADED, FAILED}

**actions**

  // User Action: Initiates an upload process by requesting a presigned URL
  requestUpload (owner: User, originalName: String, contentType: String): (file: File, uploadUrl: String)
    **requires**
      owner exists // Assumes 'User' type parameter refers to a valid user identity managed by other concepts.
    **effects**
      let newFileId = nextFileId
      let uniqueStorageKey = generateUniqueStorageKey(newFileId, originalName) // Internal logic to create a unique key for cloud storage

      add newFileId to Files
      set Files[newFileId].owner = owner
      set Files[newFileId].originalName = originalName
      set Files[newFileId].storageKey = uniqueStorageKey
      set Files[newFileId].status = PENDING
      set Files[newFileId].contentUrl = "" // Will be set upon successful upload confirmation

      increment nextFileId by 1

      // Internal function to generate a presigned URL for the given storageKey and content type
      let presignedUrl = generatePresignedUploadUrl(uniqueStorageKey, contentType) 
      return (file: newFileId, uploadUrl: presignedUrl)

  // System Action: Confirms a successful file upload, typically triggered by a cloud storage webhook or event
  **system** completeUpload (file: File, storageKey: String, stableContentUrl: String): (success: Boolean)
    **requires**
      file exists in Files
      Files[file].status = PENDING
      Files[file].storageKey = storageKey // Ensures the correct file entry is updated
    **effects**
      set Files[file].status = UPLOADED
      set Files[file].contentUrl = stableContentUrl
      return (success: true)

  // System Action: Handles notification of a failed file upload
  **system** failUpload (file: File, storageKey: String, reason: String): (success: Boolean)
    **requires**
      file exists in Files
      Files[file].status = PENDING
      Files[file].storageKey = storageKey
    **effects**
      set Files[file].status = FAILED
      // Optionally, store the reason for failure
      return (success: true)

  // User Action: Retrieves metadata for a specific file
  getFileInfo (file: File, requestingUser: User): (owner: User, originalName: String, contentUrl: String, status: UploadStatus)
    **requires**
      file exists in Files
      Files[file].owner = requestingUser // Only owner can view info by default, extended permissions via syncs
      Files[file].status = UPLOADED // Only show info for successfully uploaded files
    **effects**
      return (owner: Files[file].owner, originalName: Files[file].originalName, contentUrl: Files[file].contentUrl, status: Files[file].status)

  // User Action: Deletes a file from the system and cloud storage
  deleteFile (file: File, requestingUser: User)
    **requires**
      file exists in Files
      Files[file].owner = requestingUser // Only the owner can delete a file
    **effects**
      let keyToDelete = Files[file].storageKey
      remove file from Files
      deleteFromCloudStorage(keyToDelete) // Internal function to delete file from cloud storage

**queries**

  // Query: Returns the stable content URL for a successfully uploaded file
  getContentUrl (file: File, requestingUser: User): (url: String)
    **requires**
      file exists in Files
      Files[file].status = UPLOADED
      Files[file].owner = requestingUser // Basic authorization, can be extended by syncs
    **effects**
      return Files[file].contentUrl

  // Query: Lists all files owned by a specific user
  listOwnedFiles (user: User): (files: set of File)
    **requires** true
    **effects**
      return all File identifiers 'f' such that Files[f].owner = user
```

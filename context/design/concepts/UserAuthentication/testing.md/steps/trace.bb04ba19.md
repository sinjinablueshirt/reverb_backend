# trace:

The following describes a full trace of actions for the **operational principle** of the concept: "once a user registers with a username and password, they can later log into the same user with the same username and password."

1. **Action**: `concept.register({ username: "testuser_op", password: "password123" })`
   * **Requires**: A user with the username "testuser\_op" does not already exist in the database. (Initially, the database is empty, so this is satisfied).
   * **Effects**: A new `UserDocument` is created with a unique `_id` (e.g., "some\_id"), `username: "testuser_op"`, and `password: "password123"`. This document is inserted into the `UserAuthentication.users` collection in the MongoDB database.
   * **Returns**: `Promise.resolve({ user: "some_id" })`

2. **Action**: `concept.login({ username: "testuser_op", password: "password123" })`
   * **Requires**: A user exists in the `UserAuthentication.users` collection with `username: "testuser_op"` and `password: "password123"`. (This is satisfied due to the successful `register` action in step 1).
   * **Effects**: The database state remains unchanged.
   * **Returns**: `Promise.resolve({ user: "some_id" })` (The `_id` of the user found, which matches the ID returned during registration).

This sequence demonstrates that a user can successfully register and then subsequently log in using the same credentials, fulfilling the concept's operational principle.

# prompt: create tests that test all actions of the FileUrl concept. Be sure to make tests that follow the operational principle of the concept specification. Tests should use a sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example. Test sequences of action executions that correspond to less common cases: probing interesting corners of the functionality, undoing actions with deletions and cancellations, repeating actions with the same arguments, etc. In some of these scenarios actions may be expected to throw errors. You should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios. YOU MUST assume that all the API logic is done under the concept hood. Do not try to do anything with regards to google cloud storage API or the bucket name stored in the environment file. All of your tests MUST return the storage to its original state. If you add a file, make sure to delete it afterwards. Minimize your usage of console.logs to what Deno outputs for tests passing/failing.

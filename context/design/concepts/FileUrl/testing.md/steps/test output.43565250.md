❌ Confirm upload failed: File with GCS object name 'files/user123/0199f8b6-6be5-726e-9d6c-4f61ace8d07b/document\_op.txt' does not exist in storage. Please ensure the upload was successful.
Expected failure due to GCS object not existing (likely GCS\_BUCKET\_NAME or auth not fully configured). This confirms the requirement 'An object exists in GCS' is being checked.

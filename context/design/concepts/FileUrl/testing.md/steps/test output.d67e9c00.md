NOTE: If GCS\_BUCKET\_NAME is not a real bucket or authentication is missing, this step will fail.
Action: confirmUpload(fileName: 'document\_op.txt', gcsObjectName: 'files/user123/0199f8bd-0760-7cba-a77c-1f06d877f6b6/document\_op.txt', owner: 'user123')
❌ Confirm upload failed: File with GCS object name 'files/user123/0199f8bd-0760-7cba-a77c-1f06d877f6b6/document\_op.txt' does not exist in storage. Please ensure the upload was successful.
Expected failure due to GCS object not existing (likely GCS\_BUCKET\_NAME or auth not fully configured). This confirms the requirement 'An object exists in GCS' is being checked.

# response:

The concept's action structure has shifted from a single `uploadFile` call to a two-step process involving `requestUpload` and `confirmUpload`. This change necessitates updating the test file to reflect this new workflow, including simulating the external file upload to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the presigned URL.

The `FileDocument` interface in the test file has also been updated to align with the concept's `fileName` property, replacing the `originalFileName` used previously.

The updated tests now model the complete lifecycle:

1. **Request an upload URL**: Call `requestUpload` to get a presigned URL and a GCS object name.
2. **Simulate GCS upload**: Use `fetch` to `PUT` the file content to the obtained `uploadUrl`. This step is crucial for the `confirmUpload` action to find the file in GCS.
3. **Confirm the upload**: Call `confirmUpload` with the `fileName`, `gcsObjectName`, and `owner` to finalize the file record in the database.
4. **Verify state**: Check the database for the newly created `File` record.
5. **Delete the file**: Call `deleteFile` to remove both the database record and the GCS object.

Error handling has been adapted to reflect which new action (e.g., `requestUpload` or `confirmUpload`) should fail under specific requirement violations.

Please note that for these tests to fully pass in an environment where `npm:@google-cloud/storage` attempts actual GCS operations, the `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable must point to a real, accessible GCS bucket, and appropriate Google Cloud authentication must be configured for the Deno process. Otherwise, the simulated `fetch` upload and the `confirmUpload`'s `gcsFile.exists()` checks may result in GCS-related errors. The current test setup includes warnings about this dependency.

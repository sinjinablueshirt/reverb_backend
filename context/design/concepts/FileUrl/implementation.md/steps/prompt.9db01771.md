# prompt: Given the specification of the FileUrl concept and the current state of the concept implementation, augment the implementation to use fileData instead of filePaths to read files so that this application can work with a front end app. Your implementation should use the google cloud storage service to handle files. Remember that you cannot assume anything about the generic types passed in. Additionally, ALL google cloud storage api MUST be within the concept. you cannot rely on any client of the concept to do anything.

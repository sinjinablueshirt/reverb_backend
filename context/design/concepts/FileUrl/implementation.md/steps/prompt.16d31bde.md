# prompt: Given the specification of the FileUrl concept and the current state of the concept implementation, implement ONLY the deleteFile action. Your implementation should use the google cloud storage service to handle files. Remember that you cannot assume anything about the generic types passed in. Additionally, ALL google cloud storage api MUST be within the concept. you cannot rely on any client of the concept to do anything. Only return the method code. do NOT return anything that has already been implemented

  /**
   * deleteFile(file: File, user: User): Empty
   *
   * **Note on signature:** The prompt included `storage: Storage` in the action signature.
   * However, per concept design principles, "ALL google cloud storage api MUST be within the concept.
   * you cannot rely on any client of the concept to do anything." The `Storage` instance is
   * already a private member (`this.storage`) of the concept class. Therefore, this argument
   * has been omitted from the implementation to adhere to concept encapsulation.
   *
   * **requires**:
   *   1. The `file` with the given ID must exist in the concept's state.
   *   2. The `user` provided must be the `owner` of the specified `file`.
   *
   * **effects**:
   *   1. Removes the `file` record from the concept's state (MongoDB).
   *   2. Deletes the corresponding file content from Google Cloud Storage, ensuring its `url` becomes inaccessible.

   *
   * **effects**: Creates a new `File` entity with a unique `id`. Assigns `owner`, `fileName`, `mimeType`, `fileSize` to the new `file`. Generates a unique `storageKey` for the `file` (e.g., using `id` and `fileName`). Requests a *pre-signed upload URL* from the external storage service for this `storageKey`, `mimeType`, and `fileSize`. This URL allows a client to directly upload the file content to the storage service. Sets `uploaded` to `false`. Returns the new `file` (its `id`) and the generated `uploadUrl`.
